Scraping IMDb User Rating with Selenium

Movies and TV Shows have always filled a special place in my life and I could spend a whole afternoon watching the latest blockbusters. When Netflix arrrived to Spain I was completely thrilled at the idea of having more movies I could ever watch in one place. Then came HBO, Amazon Prime Video and others, and the options just kept growing. However, at some point I started to think that all this options were not that good because their quality was mostly mediocre, as most companies sacrificed quality over quantity. With this idea on mind I decided to **analyze the quality of content available in [Netflix]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)), [Amazon Prime Video]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows)) and [Disney]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/disney-movies-and-tv-shows))+**.

For this project I used three datasets from Kaggle. This datasets don't have any information regarding the quality of the titles so I used Selenium to scrape the User Rating from IMDb. 

Even though the idea behind the project was to proof if quality of content in streaing platforms was poor, I mostly focused on the web scraping part. 

Libraries used: **Pandas**, **Selenium**
