### Scraping IMDb User Rating with Selenium

Movies and TV Shows have always filled a special place in my life and I could spend a whole afternoon watching the latest blockbuster. When Netflix arrived to Spain I was completely thrilled at the idea of having more movies I could ever watch in one place. Then came HBO, Amazon Prime Video and the options just kept growing. However, at some point I started to think that all this possibilities were not that good because their quality was mostly mediocre as most companies sacrificed quality over quantity. 

With this idea on mind I decided to **analyze the quality of content available in [Netflix]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)), [Amazon Prime Video]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows)) and [Disney]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/disney-movies-and-tv-shows))+**.

For this project I used three datasets from Kaggle which had information about the participating cast, genres and duration but didn't have any field with information about the quality of the mvoie so, using **Selenium** I scraped IMDb's website to extrar the User Rating of each title. 

Libraries used: **Pandas**, **Selenium**
